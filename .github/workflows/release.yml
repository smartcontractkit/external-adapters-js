      # docker pull public.ecr.aws/chainlink/adapters/coingecko-adapter:develop-latest

      # On master, we build and publish containers with the tag of "latest" and another tag of the
      # adapters version contained within package.json.

      # Ex. If the value of the field "version" in the "package.json" file of the coingecko adapter is "0.0.5-beta",
      # The "coingecko-adapter" container will be resolvable with the following specifiers:
      # coingecko-adapter:latest
      # coingecko-adapter:0.0.5-beta

      # The ECR registry is reachable at public.ecr.aws/chainlink/adapters/
