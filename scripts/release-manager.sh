EA Release Manager

Usage: $0 <command> [arguments]

Commands:
  add <adapter> <version> <pr_url> <approver> [notes]
      Add an adapter to pending releases after it has been tested in infra
      
      Example:
        $0 add coingecko 1.5.0 https://github.com/.../pull/123 @myteam "Tested for 48h"
  
  mark-tested <adapter> [infra-pr-url]
      Mark an adapter as tested in infra (after infra-k8s PR merges)
      Updates tested_in_infra flag to true
      
      NOTE: This is now AUTOMATED via infra-k8s workflow!
            Only use this command for manual overrides or corrections.
      
      Example:
        $0 mark-tested coingecko https://github.com/.../pull/456
  
  release <adapter>
      Mark an adapter as released (moves from pending to released)
      This is typically done automatically by the release workflow
      
      Example:
        $0 release coingecko
  
  list
      List all adapters in pending state (ready for release)
      
      Example:
        $0 list
  
  status <adapter>
      Show detailed status of a specific adapter
      
      Example:
        $0 status coingecko
  
  remove <adapter>
      Remove an adapter from pending (cancel its release)
      
      Example:
        $0 remove coingecko
  
  help
      Show this help message

Examples:
  # After infra testing is complete, add adapter to pending
  $0 add coingecko 1.5.0 https://github.com/.../pull/123 @data-feeds-team

  # List what's ready to release
  $0 list

  # Check status of specific adapter
  $0 status coingecko

  # Release the adapter
  gh workflow run release.yml -f adapters=coingecko
