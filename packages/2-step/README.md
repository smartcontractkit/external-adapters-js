# 2-step adapters

2-step adapters read the value from a given reference contract before using that value to transform the result from the
data provider.

## Input params

- `referenceContract`: The reference contract to get a value from
- `multiply`: (Optional) Multiply amount for the on-chain value (default: 100000000)
- `operator`: The operator to use for the value transformation (one of "multiply", "divide")
- `dividend`: (Optional) Which value to use as dividend when operator is "divide" (one of "on-chain", "off-chain", default: "off-chain")

## Docker

To build a Docker container for a specific `$adapter`, use the following example, ran from the root of the repository:

```bash
make docker-2-step adapter=finnhub
```

The build argument `--build-arg` is required. This will be the directory of the adapter you wish to build.

The naming convention for market closure Docker containers will be `$adapter-2-step-adapter`.

Then run it with:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY' -e RPC_URL='YOUR_RPC_URL' -it finnhub-2-step-adapter:latest
```
