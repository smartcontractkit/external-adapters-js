# @chainlink/coingecko-adapter

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e6fef7dc: Improved matching symbol to id
- 2e6fef7dc: Added better case matching to the Overrider for CoinGecko and CoinPaprika. Now the case does not have to exactly match between the symbol in the job spec and the symbol of the data provider
