## Handling overrides in coingecko

Provided is a helper file (`./helpers/createOverrides.js`) that will fetch the coin list from Coingecko's API and add
it to the overrides file. Make changes/uncomment lines in the script to make it fit your purpose.

Run it from the adapter's directory: `node helpers/createOverrides.js`
