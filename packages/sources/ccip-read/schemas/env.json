  "description": "The CCIP Read adapter acts as the gateway server for the CCIP Read protocol as outlined here https://github.com/Arachnid/EIPs/blob/ccip-read/EIPS/eip-3668.md. It's job is to take in data from a client, fetch proofs from outside the L1 chain and return it to the client.\n\nThe optimism global endpoint reads the latest proof from an Optimism as the L2 chain and returns the proof to the caller. Currently this endpoint has the same functionality as the server in this example https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-read/tree/6d4deb917781f3becda39b9ebad6f21e037af1a6/examples/optimism-metis-gateway.",
